            <h3 class="h3-data">What is Factions?</h3>
        

 Grow your faction, expand your claims, and storm your enemies for their chunks and loot.<br>

Factions is not a new concept, and has been around for a very long time in some very popular Minecraft servers.<br>
Born to fix the age old issue in Minecraft of multiplayer server aimless griefing like in Anarchy servers and nullifying any combat like in land claim servers.<br>
Factions strikes the balance allowing players to freely build whilst maintaining competitive PvP elements.<br>

<br>

<h3 class="h3-data">What is faction power?</h3>

Each faction has a maximum power level that can only be increased by new members joining the faction.<br>

Factions will lose 4 power if a faction member is killed by other players.<br>
However, this is not permanent since their power will regenerate for each player in the faction up to their maximum power level at a rate of 1 power per minute.<br>
Dying will also reset the power regeneration counter for that player.<br>

A factions maximum power is calculated as `MAX = 1200 + (FACTION MEMBER COUNT * 800)`<br><br>

<h3 class="h3-data">What are claims?</h3>

Factions can 'claim' chunks which will remind other players who's land they're in.<br>
Players can press F3 + G to toggle chunk border visibility.<br>
Each claim will require the faction to sustain a certain amount of power.<br>

If they do not sustain this required power level,<br>
then their claims become invalid until their power is either regenerated to their required<br>
level OR they quickly remove claims so their required power level falls below their current power level.<br>
For example, if I have 5 claims then my faction will have to sustain a current power level of 5.<br><br>

<h3 class="h3-data">What are ranks?</h3>

Each player within a faction has a rank.<br>
By default every new player is a "Member" when they join.<br>
Their rank can be modified by a leader with the /f rank command. (see commands wiki) <br>
A user's rank determines which claims they have access to.<br>
For example a claim with an access level of "Commander" would only allow players with the rank of "Commander" and above to access blocks in that chunk.<br>
There is also a special "Guest" rank which can access chunks with an access level of "Member",<br>
however,<br>
they do not have full access.<br>
Guest's access levels can be changed through the /f permission command. (see commands wiki) <br><br>

The 5 ranks in order of highest to lowest:<br>

1. Owner<br>
2. Leader<br>
3. Commander<br>
4. Member<br>
5. Guest<br>
